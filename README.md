# Line_follower_robot
**Concept**  

The working of line follower robot depends on principle of **black bodies** which absorbs almost all the light they gets exposed to. The IR sensors send light and photo diodes receives the reflection.when the robot is oriented randomly along the black line,the voltage changes in photo diodes will be used to pragram the robot to align perfectly and move along the line. 

**Components used**  
* Arduino Uno  
* L298 motor driver  
* IR proximity sensors
* brushless DC motors  
* Cable wires  

**Procedure**
* Connecting circuit as shown in file circuit.png  

* Writing code in Arduino IDE  

* Supplying power to circuit  

* Testing it on black striped path

**Problems faced**
Initially alignment of robot is not accurate,then input parameters are changed by trial and error.
